=== Pyrates of the Caripyean (name changed succesfully, RB[0]) ===

There is a mystical force in the world, called mana - or magic to some.
This force is strongly attracted to pieces of a special kind of string.
These strings, when connected to mana, generate a force capable of repelling almost anything.
But, when you use a string to connect to a different source of Mana,
  * and then cross it with another string, you can disrupt it's shield in a small area.

Pirates learned to harness this string to control mana, and build giant shield generators to protect their lands.
Capitols are built on islands, and have large generaters that harness Mana.

When you start a game, you must lay out your territories. Done by "drawing" with the string in straight lines around an area - but you only get a small amount of string.
It is a good strategy to build multiple, smaller territories, as you maintain the same benefits of a single larger territory, except that you won't lose everything if you lose one territory. The problem being this strategy can cost many times the amount of string - of which there is but a limited supply.

Resources in the game are thus:
Mana (generated by the capitols of territories), wood, crew and string(generated on islands, requiring you to use some of your ships to collect them).
String is a created from the silky fibers of the Manachat plant, named after the mana it channels.

All ships, except for maybe the super class Fying Dutchman ships, require wood and crew to build.
To cross territorial borders they need to be connected to a capitol with string. Be careful not to give to much or too little string to your ships - as it is a very limited resource.
The possible flying dutchman class is actually connected to the mana in a small way like the larger instalations in the capitols. These ships do not require string to be attached to a capitol to cross lines of string - but they do cyphon some of the amounts of mana generated by the capitol they were created in - thus a large group of them could destroy your shield defenses.


For movement, there is not grid, instead each ship has a set amount of space they can move each turn.
When it comes to a units turn to move, a circle is drawn around the ship - illustrating how far it can move.
You must click inside this to move. (if we finish soon we can add calculations for clicking outside of the circle and going there over a number of turns.)


Resource ships are the same as any other kind of ship - except that you have assigned them the important task of gathering resources from islands.
These ships act autonomously, they figure out which resource is most needed in your empire, then find a the best one they can reach in the territory they are in.
You can set the percentages you want of each resource.
	ie: wood 10%, crew 20%, string 70% -- depeneding on what you want to focus on for the moment.
They then sail to the source, wait a turn, and return home laiden with riches.
Once the resources are returned, they are available to the entire empire for use, but ships will not gather resources across territory lines - so don't give them string!


For fighting, each ship has a max range, best range, normal range and boarding range.
When an enemy is within maxrange - and not behind a shield, you can attack with a longer range attack that is less accurate.
At best range you attack with a strong attack that is highly accurate.
At normal range you will broadside your opponent.
And at boarding range you put aside the, eh, nicities of cannon, and attempt to board the ship.
When you attack with your cannons, you can select one of 3 types of cannonball:
  * Regular ball - 75% hull damage, 25% crew damage
  * Chain - 50% speed, 30% hull, 20% crew
  * Grapeshot - 70% crew, 30% hull
So basically, each amount is how much of the damage caused by the attack goes to each area of weakness.
If you successfully kill all enemy crew, and you have enough crew left for both ships, and the enemy ship has not sustained too much damage to teh hull itself, you will take control of the enemy vessel.


There are several kinds of ships:
Juggernaught - a slow heavy ship with lots of armor.
Junk - a fast light ship that excels at boarding tactics.
Galley - a moderate ship.
Merchant - a fast, lightly armed ship that can carry 50% more resources.
Flying Dutchman - already explained above ^.


As you gain more string you can use it to purchase new territories. If two of your territories are touching they will be merged together - so be careful.

Destroy a enemy capitol and you take control of that territory.
Simple.
Be the last one to have a territory left!
