Most things can be done with the mouse, but can also be done with a keyboard:

R = Make a territory
Clicking on a territory and pressing SPACE = Build a ship (Ships appear in bottom menu)
ENTER = End turn

==Gameplay==

In a nutshell: The object of the game is to be the last one left with a territory.
